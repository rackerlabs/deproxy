chunked body reading
    will require a more expansive model of the request/response and the behavior of the connector(s)
compression
    ditto


no particular order:

super-easy assertions on message chains, handlings, requests, and responses - for use by importers
extract classes for handling http version 0.9, 1.0, and 1.1
    extract client connector -> Conforming vs. Bare
    extract server connector -> Conforming vs. Bare
add endpoint parameter to handler functions, so we know who handled the request ?
    no use-case for this yet

clean endpoint failure, e.g. if address already in use
    shouldn't get added to _endpoints list
    thread(s) should be shut down
option on route to be transparent or not (see http rfc) ?
    route should use the conforming client connector above
    not sure which server connector to use

server-side https
test https
test route https
