bugs
in DeproxyEndpoint.parseRequest, after calling BodyReader.readBody,
    if body is null, it should be reported in the log as null, instead of length 4
in Deproxy.makeRequest(String, …),
    when cleaning up the incoming headers parameter,
        "for (Header header : headers)" is not iterating headers, just returning the collection
        "for (String key : headers.keySet()) { data.add(key, headers[key])" doesn't handle groovy strings properly

Clean up code
    rename setUp to setup and tearDown to cleanup in spock unit tests

gradle

replace RequestParams with proper object orientation in client connectors
    DefaultClientConnector should have a nextConnector constructor parameters, instead of extending BareClientConnector
    ChunkedTransferEncodingClientConnector
        will require "distinction between message body and transfer-encoded message body" below
        this is a modification of the request, and doesn't directly concern the connection - should this be something other than a ClientConnector
            not necessarily; that describes DefaultClientConnector as well

expand test for default request headers, to include all of them, and also to include header values

un-ignore or get rid of ignored tests
port all unit tests
test StaticTcpServer

update docs
    new functionality has been added, needs to be documented
        http message utility classes
            BodyReader
            BodyWriter
            HeaderReader
            HeaderWriter
            LineReader
        diagnostic utility classes
            LocalSocketPair
            PortFinder
            StaticTcpServer
    need new logo

move apache stuff to a separate folder/subpackage

distinction between message body and transfer-encoded message body, between
        the request/response and the bytes-on-the-wire
compression (content coding)
    will likely require changes to the object model

rfc 2616 § 3.6 in BodyReader.readBody #2 --> return 501

super-easy assertions on message chains, handlings, requests, and responses - for use by importers
extract classes for handling http version 0.9, 1.0, and 1.1
    extract client connector -> Conforming vs. Bare
        create a new client connector or update an existing one to be fully compliant with RFC 2616
    extract server connector -> Conforming vs. Bare
        parseRequest and sendResponse
        clarify handler stuff, so that we can use explicit typing of handlers
add endpoint parameter to handler functions, so we know who handled the request ?
    no use-case for this yet

clean endpoint failure, e.g. if address already in use
    shouldn't get added to _endpoints list
    thread(s) should be shut down

better logging
