Clean up code
    rename DeproxyEndpoint to just Endpoint
    remove unused Handler interface
    expand test for default request headers, to include all of them, and also to include header values
    replace StaticTcpServer with something better?



update docs
    new functionality has been added, needs to be documented
        http message utility classes
            BodyReader
            BodyWriter
            HeaderReader
            HeaderWriter
            LineReader
        diagnostic utility classes
            LocalSocketPair
            PortFinder
            StaticTcpServer
    need new logo


clean endpoint failure, e.g. if address already in use
    shouldn't get added to _endpoints list
    thread(s) should be shut down




server-side https
    DeproxyEndpoint
        test
        createRawConnection
            test
    LocalSocketPair https
        test
    StaticTcpServer https
        shouldn't need any code as it just takes a socket
        test
test https
test route https


extensive tests for uri's paths and query parameters
    consider illegal chars
    consider non-ascii chars
    consider escaping


rfc 2616 § 3.6 in BodyReader.readBody #2 --> return 501


all components either:
    are 100% unconditionally compliant with RFC 2616
    are normally unconditionally compliant with RFC 2616, but have facilities
        for doing things that are not compliant when explicitly asked to by
        the user

---- 1.0 ---- below are in no particular order

use an endpoint on a different machine, and send requests & responses back to the client machine somehow


standard headers
    Accept, Accept-Charset, Accept-Encoding, Accept-Language, Accept-Ranges,
    Age, Allow, Authorization, Cache-Control, Connection, Content-Encoding,
    Content-Language, Content-Length, Content-Location, Content-MD5,
    Content-Range, Content-Type, Date, ETag, Expect, Expires, From, If-Match,
    If-Modified-Since, If-None-Match, If-Range, If-Unmodified-Since,
    Last-Modified, Location, Max-Forwards, Pragma, Proxy-Authenticate,
    Proxy-Authorization, Range, Referer, Retry-After, Server, TE, Trailer,
    Transfer-Encoding, Upgrade, User-Agent, Vary, Via, Warning, WWW-Authenticate

gradle?

replace RequestParams with proper object orientation in client connectors
    DefaultClientConnector should have a nextConnector constructor parameters, instead of extending BareClientConnector
    ChunkedTransferEncodingClientConnector
        will require "distinction between message body and transfer-encoded message body" below
        this is a modification of the request, and doesn't directly concern the connection - should this be something other than a ClientConnector
            not necessarily; that describes DefaultClientConnector as well

distinction between message body and transfer-encoded message body, between
        the request/response and the bytes-on-the-wire

compression (content coding)
    will likely require changes to the object model

better logging
    option whether or not to log request/response bodies - off by default

move apache stuff to a separate folder/subpackage

super-easy assertions on message chains, handlings, requests, and responses - for use by importers
extract classes for handling http version 0.9, 1.0, and 1.1
    extract client connector -> Conforming vs. Bare
        create a new client connector or update an existing one to be fully compliant with RFC 2616
    extract server connector -> Conforming vs. Bare
        parseRequest and sendResponse
        clarify handler stuff, so that we can use explicit typing of handlers

add endpoint parameter to handler functions, so we know who handled the request ?
