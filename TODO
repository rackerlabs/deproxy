bugs
in DeproxyEndpoint.parseRequest, after calling BodyReader.readBody,
    if body is null, it should be reported in the log as null, instead of length 4
in Deproxy.makeRequest(String, …),
    when cleaning up the incoming headers parameter,
        "for (Header header : headers)" is not iterating headers, just returning the collection
        "for (String key : headers.keySet()) { data.add(key, headers[key])" doesn't handle groovy strings properly


Clean up code
    rename setUp to setup and tearDown to cleanup in spock unit tests

gradle

expand test for default request headers, to include all of them, and also to include header values

un-ignore or get rid of ignored tests
port all unit tests
test StaticTcpServer

move apache stuff to a separate folder/subpackage

distinction between message body and transfer-encoded message body, between
        the request/response and the bytes-on-the-wire
compression (content coding)
    will likely require changes to the object model

rfc 2616 § 3.6 in BodyReader.readBody #2 --> return 501

super-easy assertions on message chains, handlings, requests, and responses - for use by importers
extract classes for handling http version 0.9, 1.0, and 1.1
    extract client connector -> Conforming vs. Bare
        create a new client connector or update an existing one to be fully compliant with RFC 2616
    extract server connector -> Conforming vs. Bare
        parseRequest and sendResponse
        clarify handler stuff, so that we can use explicit typing of handlers
add endpoint parameter to handler functions, so we know who handled the request ?
    no use-case for this yet

clean endpoint failure, e.g. if address already in use
    shouldn't get added to _endpoints list
    thread(s) should be shut down

extensive tests for uri's paths and query parameters

better logging
    option whether or not to log request/response bodies - off by default
