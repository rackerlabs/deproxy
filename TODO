Clean up code
    remove python in comments
    re-indent everything to 4-space indentation granularity

update docs
    code samples are still in python; they need to be converted to groovy
    new functionality has been added, needs to be documented

distinction between message body and transfer-encoded message body, between
        the request/response and the bytes-on-the-wire
compression (content coding)
    will likely require changes to the object model


no particular order:

super-easy assertions on message chains, handlings, requests, and responses - for use by importers
extract classes for handling http version 0.9, 1.0, and 1.1
    extract client connector -> Conforming vs. Bare
        create a new client connector or update an existing one to be fully complient with RFC 2616
    extract server connector -> Conforming vs. Bare
        HandlerContext
        2-parameter handlers
add endpoint parameter to handler functions, so we know who handled the request ?
    no use-case for this yet

clean endpoint failure, e.g. if address already in use
    shouldn't get added to _endpoints list
    thread(s) should be shut down
option on route to be transparent or not (see http rfc) ?
    route should use the conforming client connector above
    not sure which server connector to use

server-side https
test https
test route https
extensive tests for uri's paths and query parameters
    consider illegal chars
    consider non-ascii chars
    consider escaping

better logging
    option whether or not to log request/response bodies - off by default
